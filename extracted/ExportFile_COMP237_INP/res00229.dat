 &lt;h4&gt;Copyright Permissions Log&lt;/h4&gt; 
 &lt;h5&gt;How do I get permission to use a resource?&lt;/h5&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;When searching for materials to use within a course, please make sure you are&amp;nbsp;appropriately using the resource based on it's copyright license. Every effort should be made to attribute the original author by providing appropriate citation of the resource. Media with a &lt;a href="https://creativecommons.org/" rel="noopener"&gt;Creative Common&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;licences can easily be referenced within the course and you are encouraged to review the license agreements before making them public to students. If a license is not clearly stated, then the author should be contacted.&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;If you have any questions or need help with copyright protocols, please contact the Copyright Librarian at &lt;a href="/bbcswebdav/courses/COMP237_INP.DEV.ZIP/web_resources/mailto:copyright@centennialcollege.ca" rel="noopener"&gt;copyright@centennialcollege.ca&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;or visit the&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://library.centennialcollege.ca/help-services/for-faculty/" rel="noopener"&gt;Libraries Help &amp;amp; Services page for Faculty&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;h6&gt;Tips for Contacting the Author&lt;/h6&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;When asking for permission to use a copyrighted resource, keep the following in mind:&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;ul&gt; 
  &lt;li&gt;What is the resource called?&lt;/li&gt; 
  &lt;li&gt;Who is the author, and what is their contact information?&lt;/li&gt; 
  &lt;li&gt;How many students on average will be using the resource per term?&lt;/li&gt; 
  &lt;li&gt;How the resource will be distributed (via single link or printed handout)&lt;/li&gt; 
 &lt;/ul&gt; 
 &lt;h6&gt;Permission to "Adapt Resource" Sample Email&lt;/h6&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;Use the following sample email when requesting permission to retrieve close captioning for a YouTube video:&lt;/p&gt; 
 &lt;div&gt; 
  &lt;p&gt;Dear [YouTube user name],&lt;/p&gt; 
  &lt;p&gt;I am [teaching/designing] a course at Centennial College in Toronto on [course title] and would like to use your video, entitled ["Video title"] in the course materials.&lt;/p&gt; 
  &lt;p&gt;However, before I am able to use the video in the course I need to ensure that it is closed-captioned in order to meet requirements for online presentation. I was hoping that you might have a copy of a closed captioned version and, failing that, would be so kind as to grant permission for me to do so. I would, of course, provide you with a copy of the captioned video.&lt;/p&gt; 
  &lt;p&gt;Thank you for your help, and I look forward to hearing from you.&lt;/p&gt; 
  &lt;p&gt;Kind regards,&lt;/p&gt; 
  &lt;p&gt;[Instructor's name]&lt;/p&gt; 
   
 &lt;/div&gt; 
  
 &lt;h5&gt;List of Permissions&lt;/h5&gt; 
 &lt;p&gt;Document and store the letter/email where the permission was granted below. Please also indicate where is the resource is located within the course.&lt;/p&gt;
