It is the only container exposed to the outside world (so your Chrome Extension can hit it).python:3.11-slim (Custom Build)8000memory_storeThe Vector DB. Runs ChromaDB. It stores the COMP_237.pdf embeddings. It uses a Volume so your data survives restarts.chromadb/chroma:latest8000 (Internal only)cache_layerThe Short-Term Memory. Runs Redis. Stores the LangGraph "State Checkpoints" (conversation history) and locks for rate limiting.redis:alpine6379observerThe X-Ray. Runs Langfuse or VoltOps.
