# Go-to-Market (GTM) Strategy
**Product:** Centennial Course Marshal (AI Tutor)
**Target Audience:** Centennial College Students (COMP 237) & Faculty

## 1. Value Proposition

### For Students ("The Super-Study Buddy")
-   **Problem:** "I don't understand this slide," "The professor answers too slowly," "I'm stuck on this error."
-   **Solution:** Instant, 24/7 answers *grounded* in the actual course material. Not generic ChatGPT answers, but answers that reference *Week 3 Slide 14*.
-   **Hook:** "It knows exactly what you're studying."

### For Faculty ("The Teaching Assistant that Sleeps")
-   **Problem:** "Students ask the same questions repeatedly," "Students use ChatGPT to cheat."
-   **Solution:** An AI that refuses to give answers (Integrity Law) and guides students instead. It offloads 80% of the repetitive email load.
-   **Hook:** "It forces them to learn, not just copy."

## 2. Launch Strategy (The "Trojan Horse")

### Stage 1: The "Beta" (Soft Launch)
-   **Who:** 1 Professor (COMP 237 Lead) + 1 Section (30 Students).
-   **How:** Distribute as a "Pilot Program" side-loaded extension.
-   **Pitch:** "Free AI tool to help you study for the midterm. It has all the slides loaded."

### Stage 2: The "Official Tool" (Expansion)
-   **Metric:** If 30% of the pilot students use it weekly, pitch to the Department Chair.
-   **Requirement:** Must have "Institutional Email Required" (already built) to prove security.
-   **Channel:** Canvas/Blackboard Announcement.

## 3. Pricing / Business Model
*Initial model is "Free Pilot" to gain adoption.*

-   **B2B (Institution License):** Sell to the College.
    -   Pricing: Per Active Student / Semester.
    -   Value: Retention rates, Academic Integrity compliance.
-   **B2C (Student Pro):** (Fallback)
    -   Free: Basic Q&A.
    -   Paid: "Mastery Mode" (Quizzes, Exam Prep, Code Execution).

## 4. Marketing Assets Needed
1.  **Demo Video (60s):** Show a student asking a question -> Agent citing a slide -> Agent refusing to cheat -> Agent running code.
2.  **One-Pager PDF:** For Faculty. Emphasis on "Safety" and "Curriculum Alignment".
3.  **Installation Guide:** Simple "How to add to Chrome" for non-tech students.
